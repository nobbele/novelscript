The easy to use and intuitive novel scripting language!

Free and open source library written in the Rust programming language.

![Example code](https://github.com/nobbele/novelscript/blob/master/example.png)
<sup>Syntax highlighting done using the Visual Studio Code extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nobbele.novelscript-vscode)</sup>

The best way to use this language would be with an engine such as [NS Engine](https://github.com/nobbele/ns-engine) 
which allows you to create scripts in novelscript to make your own visual novel game.

You can contact me on Discord at nobbele#7065 if you have any question about the codebase, the language or anything like that. 
I am always open for answering them.

Feel free to make issues and pull requests too, I greatly appreciate any contributions!
